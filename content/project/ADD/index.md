title: Big Data Analysis for Hyper Spectral Images
summary: It is a project focused on finding the optimal wavelength band that can improve the performance of vehicle detection from hyperspectral images and converting it into a more efficient form of data. As a result of this project, "Channel Sampler in Hyperspectral Images for Vehicle Detection" (GRSS, 2021) has been published.  
This project was conducted with funding from the Agency Defense Development (contact number UE191095FD) and the National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No.2020R1F1A1065573).
