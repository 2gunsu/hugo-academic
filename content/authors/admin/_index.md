I am a Master's Student doing research in [CVIP Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/cnu-cvip) under the supervision of [Prof. Donghyeon Cho](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zj-NER4AAAAJ&hl=en) of the Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungnam National University since April 2020.

My research area is 3D perception in an autonomous driving environment, and I am currently developing monocular 3D object detection system using weak supervision from 2D labels.
